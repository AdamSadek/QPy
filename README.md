# QPy
 QPy is a python module that aims at making many quantum mechanical computations/simulations operable in no more than a line of code. For example, the tise.solve() feature solves the Time-Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation, plots the Wavefunction and prints the eigenvalues (something that would usually take a few hundred lines of code to do). This numerical package is useful for anyone taking QM1 as the syntax barely requires a learning curve and makes rigorous problems solved in seconds!


# State of the project
This version is not nearly complete and this is simply the first launch with around 4 (fairly incomplete) features: Plotter (which plots some algebraic QM equations), Solver (which solves some algebraic QM equations), tise (which solves the 1D time independant schrodinger eqn for a specific V(x) using the numerov method), and psiTools (which is a feature that allows several wavefunction-related operations such as normalization, probability calculation, expectation value solver and much more). 

I am currently working on integrating Quantum operators and many statistical quantities that could be obtained by using quantum operators. Examples include expecation values, variance and standard deviations, etc. This should hopefully be done by tomorrow.
