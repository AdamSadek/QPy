# QPy
 QPy is a python module that aims at making many quantum mechanical computations/simulations operable in no more than a line of code. For example, the tise.solve() feature solves the Time-Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation, plots the Wavefunction and prints the eigenvalues (something that would usually take a few hundred lines of code to do). This numerical package is useful for anyone taking or teaching QM1 as the syntax barely requires a learning curve and makes rigorous problems to be solved in seconds!
